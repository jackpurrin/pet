## to-do list

- [ ] get basic graphics working in pygame
- [ ] make a "cost of care system"
    - this means:
    - food and supply costs
    - vet visits or health care
    - toy or activity purchaes
    - budget limits or in-game currency
- [ ] have customization on the pet (name the pet, choose cat or dog, etc.)
- [ ] pet care features (feed, play, rest, clean, etc.)
- [ ] reactions based on care level
- [ ] a total of care related expenses
- [ ] (optional) savings goals or earning systems
